# Scale

Scale is a simulation of modern day society, from the bottom-up. 
Each individual has its own thought model, which means that every action has its importance and influences the environment.  
Scale is not a video game, as this universe shall be observed, but with no (or little) interactions possible.  
This means that a lot of power can be invested into making it a unique persistent world,
where attention to detail is achievable. 

## How ?  
This is of course very ambitious, so inspired by the WASM project,
a minimal viable product should be made where features are increasingly added.

The first [milestone](https://github.com/Uriopass/Scale/projects/1) is to be able to have humans having homes and a workplace,
using their feet or their cars to go there.  

## Devblog

I will try to keep a blog of the updates to Scale [here](http://douady.paris/blog/index.html).
